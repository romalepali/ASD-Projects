			<p>Hi! I've updated this part of the website. I'll post an update each time I'll finish a part of a page. I've finished the Home Button, Profile Button, Gallery Button and About Button. I've also finished the Cover of this webpage and the Profile Picture. And I'll continue updating until I'll finish the whole webpage. Hope you'll like it and the other updates I will post here. Thank you for viewing this webpage that I personally designed and planned.</p>

			<p>Hi! I've updated the Profile Page of this webpage. Literally, I've made the Profile Page as a Resume and I arranged it as an Office Word Document since it needs to be formal. The Design of every pages is the same as the Home Page but the differences between every pages are its contents. And once again I will update this part of the page every accomplishment that I will do in this Minor Project. This Part the part of the page is like a blog of my progress and don't mind with the grammar just the intention.</p>
